// Who is still in the room: the ping loop's silent-link drop and the host's duplicate-name probe.

//
// Every device answers a ping at once, so a link that has said nothing for a while is a device that
// vanished without a clean close (a crashed or killed tab, a laptop asleep, Wi-Fi gone): no pagehide,
// and the data channel's own close can take minutes to surface (#124). The ping loop drops such a
// link, the same path as a close. How long "a while" is depends on who is on the other end, because
// the other side cannot tell a stalled tab from a gone one:
//   - a computer: SILENT_MS. Its tab answers pings from the message loop even when hidden.
//   - a phone: PHONE_SILENT_MS. Its screen locks and the browser freezes the page; a phone that
//     comes back within a minute keeps its link and its layers.
//   - the host, as a guest sees it: HOST_SILENT_MS. The host's main thread does the heaviest work
//     (its shard load, the first and last layers), and a guest that drops a live host tears the
//     room down for itself.
//   - a device mid-load (its shard still loading, on either end): never. A worker's main thread
//     can block for seconds on a shard, and dropping it mid-load throws away the start. A device
//     that really died there is still noticed when its data channel closes.
// Any sign of life counts: a message, a pong, a hidden-state frame or a keep-alive byte on the wire
// (room/transport.js stamps link.rxAt). A late tick means this tab was the one stalled (throttled,
// or a long task): its queue of pongs is not read yet, so it judges nobody on that tick.

// The host pings every device in the chain every HB_BUSY_MS while an answer runs (the plain
// `ping`/`pong` every protocol version answers, so this needs no protocol change) and counts
// anything it receives from a device as a sign of life: a pong, any control message, any slice
// on any of its wire channels. A device silent for longer than deadAfter(rtt) is held: every lap
// in flight waits for it and so does the next question. If it answers again it simply carries on
// (a freeze); one that stays silent is dropped by the ping loop (isSilentGone above), which takes
// the departure path (`ai-degraded`, re-deal).

// everything behind it until SCTP retransmits it (an RTO, ~1 s at first, doubling on each loss of
// the same packet). The silence limit has to cover a double loss at the worst latency we support
// (300 ms one way, 5% loss) without a false alarm, and stay within ~3-5 s. Measured with
// tests/e2e/room_drop.mjs on 3 devices, Qwen3 1.7B: the longest silence was 0.65 s on a LAN,
// 2.5 s at RTT 300 ms + 5% loss and 3.65 s at RTT 600 ms + 5% loss, against limits of 3.5, 3.9
// and 4.8 s (docs/protocol.md, "Drop detection").

# @pooled/cli

`pooled serve` turns a [Pooled](https://pooled.run) room into a local OpenAI and Anthropic compatible endpoint. Any tool that talks to either API through a base URL then runs on the room's model: the model is split across the phones and laptops in the room, and this command only relays requests.

```
$ npx @pooled/cli serve ABCD
pooled serve · room ABCD · Qwen3.6 35B MoE · Q4
  OpenAI     http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1         (OPENAI_BASE_URL, any API key)
  Anthropic  http://127.0.0.1:8080            (ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL)
  bound to 127.0.0.1 only · no token (set POOLED_TOKEN to require one)
```

Requirements: Node 22 or newer. No GPU is needed on this machine. The room's host page must be open, and the room's model started for requests to be answered (until then they get `503` with `Retry-After: 5`).

The room menu's **Use from code** shows this command with the room's code.

## How it works

A browser tab cannot accept HTTP connections, so this small Node process joins the room as one more member: an **API client** with no layers, over the same WebRTC data channels the room's devices use ([peerjs](https://peerjs.com) on [node-datachannel](https://github.com/murat-dogan/node-datachannel)). Each HTTP request becomes one question to the room. The room shows the client as its own card, and its exchanges in the chat (under the room's "who sees the chat" setting), marked "via API".

- Every request is stateless: your tool sends the whole conversation each time, and the room answers it without touching its own chat. When your tool resends the room's previous answer unchanged, the room reuses its caches and prefills only the new turn.
- One generation runs in the room at a time. The chat, Code mode and API clients share one queue. Requests wait here first (up to `--max-queue`, 8 by default) and streams get a keep-alive every 10 s while they wait.
- If the host page reloads, in-flight requests fail and the client reconnects when the room is back. If the host disconnects the client, or turns API clients off, it stops and answers `503`.

## Options

```
pooled serve <ROOM CODE | room link> [options]

  --port <n>        HTTP port (default 8080)
  --token-file <f>  require the token in this file as "Authorization: Bearer <t>" or
                    "x-api-key: <t>" on every request (or set POOLED_TOKEN)
  --token <t>       the same, given on the command line (other local users can read it with ps)
  --name <s>        how the room shows this client (default: "pooled serve" and 4 random letters)
  --signal <h:p>    PeerJS signaling server, as the room page's ?signal= (default: PeerJS cloud)
  --max-queue <n>   requests that may wait here before 429 / 529 (default 8)
  --quiet / --json-log
```

The endpoint listens on `127.0.0.1` only. Requests whose `Host` is not `127.0.0.1:<port>` / `localhost:<port>`, and any request with an `Origin` header, are refused (403), so a web page cannot use the room through your browser. Without a token any API key is accepted (some tools insist on one). With one (`POOLED_TOKEN`, `--token-file` or `--token`), every path needs it except `/health`, which then answers only `{"ok": true}`.

## APIs

| Endpoint | |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI chat completions, streaming (`stream: true`, `stream_options.include_usage`) and not |
| `POST /v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages, streaming and not |
| `GET /v1/models`, `GET /v1/models/{id}` | the room's model, `pooled/<model>` (Anthropic's shape when the request has `anthropic-version` or `x-api-key`) |
| `GET /health` | `{ok, room, connected, ready, model, queue, served}` for scripts; with a token set and not given, only `{ok: true}` |

Parameters: `max_tokens` / `max_completion_tokens` (default 1024 for OpenAI, capped by the room's context), `temperature` (0 is greedy; OpenAI 0 to 2, Anthropic 0 to 1; absent uses the room's setting), `top_k` (1 to 64, default 40), `stop` / `stop_sequences` (up to 4), thinking (OpenAI `reasoning_effort` other than `none` / `minimal`, returned as `reasoning_content`; Anthropic `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens}`; once the reasoning reaches `budget_tokens` the think block is closed and the rest of `max_tokens` goes to the answer). `model` can be any string. `top_p` and `seed` are accepted and ignored. `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` (OpenAI) and `usage.cache_read_input_tokens` (Anthropic) report the prompt tokens the room already held.

Not in v1 (each a clear `400`): tool calls / function calling, images and other non-text content, `n > 1`, logprobs, JSON mode, an assistant message last (prefill). `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/responses` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens` are `404`.

## Tools

### curl

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model": "pooled", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}], "stream": true}'

curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/messages -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'anthropic-version: 2023-06-01' \
  -d '{"model": "pooled", "max_tokens": 200, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}]}'
```

### OpenAI SDK

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", api_key="pooled")
r = client.chat.completions.create(model="pooled", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}])
print(r.choices[0].message.content)
```

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI({ baseURL: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", apiKey: "pooled" });
const stream = await client.chat.completions.create({ model: "pooled", messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hi" }], stream: true });
for await (const chunk of stream) process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "");
```

### Anthropic SDK

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080", api_key="pooled")
m = client.messages.create(model="pooled", max_tokens=500, messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}])
print(m.content[0].text)
```

### Continue

In `~/.continue/config.yaml`:

```yaml
models:
  - name: Pooled room
    provider: openai
    model: pooled
    apiBase: http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
    apiKey: pooled
    roles: [chat, edit]
```

Autocomplete wants a small, fast local model; a room's answers take a lap through every device.

### Open WebUI

Settings → Connections → OpenAI API: URL `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`, any key. (With Open WebUI in Docker, the bridge on the host is not at `127.0.0.1` from inside the container, and v1 does not listen on other addresses; run Open WebUI on the host, or with `--network=host`.)

### LiteLLM

```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: pooled
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/pooled
      api_base: http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
      api_key: pooled
```

## Errors

Errors come in each API's own shape (`{"error": {...}}` / `{"type": "error", "error": {...}}`):

| | OpenAI | Anthropic |
|---|---|---|
| bad request, unsupported feature, prompt over the room's context | 400 | 400 |
| missing or wrong key (with `--token`) | 401 | 401 |
| foreign Host, or an Origin header | 403 | 403 |
| queue full here or in the room | 429 | 529 |
| model not ready, host gone, client disconnected by the host, the host pressed Stop | 503 | 529 |
| the room sent nothing for a request for 5 minutes (30 while the host queues it) | 504 | 504 |
| generation failed in the room | 500 | 500 |

Once a stream has started, an error comes as an error chunk (OpenAI, no `[DONE]`) or an `error` event (Anthropic).

## Development

```bash
cd cli && npm install
node bin/pooled.js serve ABCD --signal 127.0.0.1:9000   # against a room page opened with ?signal=127.0.0.1:9000
```

Unit tests (`tests/unit/serve_*_test.js`, Deno) cover the request mapping and the byte-exact streams; `tests/e2e/serve.mjs` runs a real room with Qwen3 1.7B in headless Chromium and checks both APIs end to end, with the official SDKs. Design: [docs/design/serve.md](../docs/design/serve.md).
